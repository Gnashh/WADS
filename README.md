## What is Node.js
Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

## The V8 JavaScript Engine
V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.

V8 is the JavaScript engine i.e. it parses and executes JavaScript code. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs (they all makeup runtime environment) are provided by the browser.

The cool thing is that the JavaScript engine is independent of the browser in which it's hosted. This key feature enabled the rise of Node.js. V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in 2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded, V8 became the engine that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in JavaScript.

The Node.js ecosystem is huge and thanks to V8 which also powers desktop apps, with projects like Electron.


## ðŸ“Œ Essential JavaScript Concepts
- **Lexical Structure**
- **Expressions**
- **Data Types**
- **Classes**
- **Variables**
- **Functions**
- **this Operator**
- **Arrow Functions**
- **Loops**
- **Scopes**
- **Arrays**
- **Template Literals**
- **Strict Mode**
- **ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and Beyond**

With these concepts in mind, you are well on your way to becoming a proficient JavaScript developer, both in the browser and in **Node.js**.

## ðŸ“Œ Asynchronous Programming
The following concepts are also key to understand asynchronous programming, which is one of the fundamental parts of Node.js:

- **Asynchronous programming and callbacks**
- **Timers**
- **Promises**
- **sync and wait**
- **Closures**
- **The Event Loop**

Happy coding! ðŸš€
